#The first set of projects as provided by FreeCodeCamp.org.

Inside the folder are 5 separate, bruchure style web-pages, specifically focused on developing understanding of HTML + CSS.

Each project focused on specific aspects of HTML structure and CSS.

Tribute page - Focuses on understanding the basics of layout in HTML with simple CSS,
    including ensuring the fonts and colours used in the project are easy to read as the web-page does demand focusing your attention at the text.

Survey Form page - Another project focusing on the HTML structure of forms. CSS is again fairly simple.

Product Landing page - This project uses more advanced CSS techniques like flexbox to help build comfort with the more powerful tools CSS provides for styling.
    The HTML also now follows a more conventional structure including navbars, headers, sections with articles and footers.

Technical Documentation page - A simpler website, this time with more text. CSS here is focused on ease of readability with a more complex navigation bar.

Personal Portfolio page - A more stylized website using the more powerful components of CSS with flexbox and grid displays. The colours and fonts were more carefully chosen
    for a complementary look.
